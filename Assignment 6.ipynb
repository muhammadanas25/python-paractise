    "Q2 ) \n",
    "•\tIt provides a clear modular structure for programs which makes it good for defining abstract datatypes in which implementation details are hidden\n",
    "•\tObjects can also be reused within an across applications. The reuse of software also lowers the cost of development. More effort is put into the object-oriented analysis and design, which lowers the overall cost of development.\n",
    "•\tIt makes software easier to maintain. Since the design is modular, part of the system can be updated in case of issues without a need to make large-scale changes\n",
    "•\tReuse also enables faster development. Object-oriented programming languages come with rich libraries of objects, and code developed during projects is also reusable in future projects.\n",
    "•\tIt provides a good framework for code libraries where the supplied software components can be easily adapted and modified by the programmer. This is particularly useful for developing graphical user interfaces.\n",
    "•\tBetter Productivity as OOP techniques enforce rules on a programmer that, in the long run, help her get more work done;\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3)  \n",
    "•\tPython method is called on an object, unlike a function. In our example above, we call start() on the object ‘car’. Conversely, we call Python function quite generically- we don’t call it on any object. Since we call a method on an object, it can access the data within it.\n",
    "•\tA method may alter an object’s state, but Python function usually only operates on it, and then prints something or returns a value.\n",
    "Q4) \n",
    "Class: A class is a code template for creating objects. Objects have member variables and have behavior associated with them.\n",
    "Object: Object is simply a collection of data (variables) and methods (functions) that act on those data. And, class is a blueprint for the object.\n",
    "Attribute: A class attribute is a Python variable that belongs to a class rather than a particular object. It is shared between all the objects of this class and it is defined outside the constructor function, __init__(self,...), of the class.\n",
    "Behavior: Behave. behave is behavior-driven development, Python style. Behavior-driven development (or BDD) is an agile software development technique that encourages collaboration between developers, QA and non-technical or business participants in a software project.\n"
